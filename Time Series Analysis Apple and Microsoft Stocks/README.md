Data Analysis

I used yfinance API to collect the stock price data of Apple and Microsoft.

I made a time series between current date and two years before for each stock.

I then drew line charts to see each ones' trends.

Candlestick charts to see the fall and rises of the price on each date.

Made interactive charts with sliders and several options for better visualization.
