Google Search Data Analysis with Python

Google data can be ued to tell stories. Lots and lots of them. 
In this project I used the pytrends API to be able to use the data from Google Trends to gain some insights
about a subject of my interest "Cyber Security" as well as exploring the Swiss Google search trends.

Other libraries I used: pandas, matplotlib.

I first created a dataframe on the query " Cyber Security".

I looked into the countries with highest interest in this query and found out the top 10:

I visualized them with matplotlib:

Then I looked into the trending google searches in Switzerland:

As well as the real time trends:

I used matplotlib to visualize the upward or downward trend of searches of "Cyber Security" over time:

I also added my conclusion at the end in the comments:
